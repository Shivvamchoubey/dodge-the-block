Project Report: Dodge the Enemies
1. Introduction
This project involves the design and development of a simple 2D arcade-style game using Python and the pygame library. The game challenges players to control a character that must avoid multiple falling enemies. It serves as an introduction to game development concepts such as event handling, collision detection, scoring systems, and rendering graphics.

2. Objectives
- To implement a playable game using Python and pygame.
- To demonstrate fundamental game development concepts:
- Player movement and control
- Enemy spawning and movement
- Collision detection
- Score tracking and display
- To create an engaging and interactive experience that tests player reflexes.
- To provide a foundation for future enhancements such as sound effects, difficulty scaling, and multiple levels.
